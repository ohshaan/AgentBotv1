# LeaveBot

This project contains a simple HR assistant built with Streamlit. The code lives inside the `leavebot` package.

## Running the app

1. Install Python 3.8+ and the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit numpy openai
   ```
   (Add any other dependencies you require.)

2. Run the Streamlit application from the repository root:
   ```bash
   streamlit run leavebot/main.py
   ```

The `leavebot` directory now contains an `__init__.py` file so it can be imported as a package.
